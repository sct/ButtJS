# ButtBot Discord (A Discord ButtBot)

⚠️ **Buttbot now has a fancy website!** https://buttbot.net

ButtBot Discord is a homage to my favorite IRC bot in existence, the buttbot. It serves one simple purpose, comedy.

ButtBot Discord currently pales in comparison to the original buttbots beautiful and intelligent architecture but still tends to create the same amount of laughs.

Finally updated this to work again on the latest API.

## I want ButtBot on my server!

If you want to add ButtBot to your server I am hosting the latest version at all times off a personal server. You can click the link below to request ButtBot to join your server.
